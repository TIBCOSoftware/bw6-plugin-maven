This will install the Maven Plugin to the TibcoHome. 

### First Steps

Running the Maven Build from Studio.

a. Open the Studio.

b. Right-Click on the Application project.

c. The Context Menu will show the option "Generate POM for Application".

d. Clicking it will launch the POM Generation UI.

e. There are two platforms supported by this plugin -
- CloudFoundry (follow step f)
- Docker + Kubernetes (follow step g)
NOTE - For Docker/Kubernetes you also need to download gCloud-sdk and kubectl (CLIs), and make sure you add them to your path environment-variable. 

f. Enter your PCF instance configuration details here and Click Finish.

        1. PCF Target = https://api.run.pivotal.io
        
        2. PCF Server Name = PCF_UK_credential (Define this as <\server> inside your config/settings.xml of Apache Maven Home)        
                <server>
                        <id>PCF_UK_credential</id>
                        <username>admin</username>
                        <password>xxxxxxxxxxxx</password>
                </server> 
                
       3. PCF Org 
       4. PCF Space
       5. Number of App Instance 
       6. App Memory (Minimum should be 1024 MB)
       7. App Buildpack (BWCE buildpack which developer as pushed to PCF instance)

g. Enter Docker + Kubernetes / Openshift details 

       1. Docker Host 
       2. Docker Cert Path
       3. Image name (You can provide public/private repo as part of the image name like - gcr.io/<project_id>/<image-name>) 
       4. BWCE image (BWCE Runtime base image)
       5. Maintainer (your name/email)
       6. checkbox- if you want to run this image on Docker host. If yes, you will see Docker run configurations.

       11. Container port
       12. Namespace (Kubernetes namespace - Openshift project)
       13. Env Variables (key=value comma seperated)

h. The Project will be converted to Maven (Eclipse Project) nature. Note the workspace will index after generating POM files for the first time and may take some time. You can continue with the steps below by allowing this indexing to run in the background.
 - You will find parent project will get created in your workspace with a pom file.
 - You will find in your application project properties files are getting created for dev and prod environments, but, if you have more environments you can manually just create copies of one of these properties file and rename it to your another environment (eg. pcfqa.properties, docker-qa.properties, k8s-qa.properties etc.). By default, both dev and prod properties are same, and contains values which you have specified from studio pop-up, so you can manually edit these values in properties file for your environment (prod / dev).  
 
Property files:
 - PCF - pcfdev.properties and pcfprod.properties and variable name as pcf.property.file
 - Docker - docker-dev.properties and docker-prod.properties and variable name as docker.property.file
 - K8S - k8s-dev.properties and k8s-prod.properties and variable name as k8s.property.file

i. Open Run/Debug Configurations. Create a new Maven Build.

j. Under the "Base directory" choose add variable for pom location choose ${project_loc} or browse parent project as workspace. 

k. In the 'Goal' enter the goal to be executed. 

- Make sure you add initialize before all maven goals.
- 'package' goal is standard Maven goal, which is independent of cf-maven-plugin and can be executed to create application 'EAR'. 
- Below are platform specific goals:

CloudFoundry - cf:push , cf:scale etc
http://docs.run.pivotal.io/buildpacks/java/build-tool-int.html

#### Docker and Kubernetes / Openshift - 

 - clean package initialize fabric8:build (package the EAR file into a docker image)
 - initialize fabric8:push (package the EAR file into a docker image and push to an docker registry)
 - initialize fabric8:install fabric8:cluster-start -Dfabric8.mode=<openshift|kubernetes> (before push make sure you generate token and authorize your docker host for GCP/AWS/Azure repo, follow steps below) (the mode start a local minishift or minikube for quick testing)
 - initialize fabric8:resource (creates the necessary yaml objects for k8s/openshift)
 - initialize fabric8:deploy (apply the resources against k8s/openshift)

 #### One-liner tricks :

 Start a local cluster (minishift or minikube)

 - mvn initialize fabric8:cluster-start package fabric8:build fabric8:push fabric8:resource fabric8:deploy

 Stop the cluster

- mvn initialize fabric8:cluster-stop

### GCP notes
Docker authorize for GCP docker repo before trying fabric8:push or docker:push

--- Windows ---
gcloud auth print-access-token
docker login -u _token -p "your token" https://gcr.io

--- Linux/OSX ----
docker login -u _token -p "$(gcloud auth print-access-token)" https://gcr.io

#### AWS ECR notes
Docker authorize for AWS ECR docker repo before trying fabric8:push or docker:push

--- Linux/OsX ----
aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region <region> | sh -


#### kubernetes notes

1.Create your secret key 
kubectl create secret docker-registry myregistrykey --docker-server=DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER --docker-username=DOCKER_USER --docker-password=DOCKER_PASSWORD --docker-email=DOCKER_EMAIL
secret "myregistrykey" created.
Then add the newly created key to your Kubernetes service account.
2. Retrieve the current service account
kubectl get serviceaccounts default -o yaml > ./sa.yaml
3.Edit sa.yaml and add the ImagePullSecret after Secrets
imagePullSecrets:
- name: myregistrykey
4.Update the service account 
kubectl replace serviceaccount default -f ./sa.yaml




l. You can try other goals from studio, by creating new Maven Run Configurations for different goals , or from terminal pointing to your workspace using 'mvn initialize cf:command -Dpcf.property.file=pcfdev.properties'

NOTE: For all non-web application if you are using PCF Elastic Runtime 1.6 or above (Diego) then, it will give health-check error while cf:push, so you have to use PCF CLI (6.13 or above) to set health-check as 'none' after pushing your application and re-push after setting health-check as 'none'.  You can use below command on CLI -
cf set-health-check App_Name none
